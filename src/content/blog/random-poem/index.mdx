A short poem I came up with while staring into the sea, reflecting on the soul's perseverance and its insignificance in comparison to the vastness of nature.
<Comment title="Short Poem" content="The sea as vast as the universe in this contained space, I am no one but an insignificant character sailing alone."/>
