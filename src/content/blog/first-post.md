Welcome to my First blog post, If you don't know me, read my [about me](/about).<br>

I kinda want to get into blogging(I intend to document my masters journey here..) so I wanted to revamp my previous website and found Astro, which made it easy
and lightweight to develop websites. I love learning new stuff constantly, so I intended to make a new one with this framework.

I'm into competitive programming these days so I would be focusing less on personal projects, every time I find something interesting or rather something interestingly dumb.. I am going to make a blog post about it here.
So if you want to stay updated with my ramblings just add my `RSS` feed to your news reader app or something.
