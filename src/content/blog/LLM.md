This blog does not emphasise on the idea of writing code to implement a Large Language model(Except for implementing Bertopic algorithm at the end for beginners) rather it majorly focuses on giving you a simple idea on how does the architectures work.

So, before understanding all these architectures and the Math behind Large Language Models. We need to know what is a Neural Network. So neurons are something that computes some raw values.

Now that you have got a rough idea what a neural network is, now its time focus on the math. So, how does a neural network?, general convolutional networks train the model to recognise images let's say 1,2,3,4,5. What does these Networks calculate?

The computer or the model in our case does not actually understand what a *word* is or what a image is. So we need to make it understand what these are.

So if you move to the basic layer of a image, its just a bunch of patterns with colored pixels, we can just focus on the Black and white pixels naming them with values 1 for white and 0 for black. Lets say you input a Image with 28x28 Pixels, How do you feed this Image into data?.

Firstly the neural network generates random weights and biases for every neuron that connects to the hidden layer. It then converts
